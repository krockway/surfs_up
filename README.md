# surfs_up

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to understand the weather data in Ohau in June and December. The weather information will be used to justify opening a surf & ice cream shop on the island.

## Results: 
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
* Over 75% of the days in June have a temperature over 73 degrees Farenheit

* Over 50% of the days in December have a temperature over 71 degrees Farenheit - ideal for ice cream eating on the beach.

* The lowest temperature recorded in either month was 56 degrees, but the majority was in the high 60s to low 80s

## Summary: 
The weather in Ohau has proven to be great in both June & December (with the assumption that the weather in between is also great), therefore it seems like a logical place to open the surf & ice cream shop.

I would also explore the relationship between temperature and precipitation. If the temp is warm, but it's raining, how will that impact the surf conditions? Similiarly, does this alter the desire to eat ice cream?
Secondly, I would be interested to get data on the surf conditions at each of the stations. When comparing the surf conditions with the weather, it would help pinpoint the best spot on the island to open the shop.
